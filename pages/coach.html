            <p class="card1__text paragraph">In my English teaching career, a pivotal moment came when I decided to
                transition into coaching, aiming to redefine what learning means for my students. This shift wasn't just
                about language acquisition; it was about embracing a more personalized, depth-oriented approach.
                Specializing in academic and business English, I've guided adult students from around the globe, helping
                them navigate the nuances of language learning. By focusing on their individual learning styles and the
                practical application of English in real-world scenarios, I empower students to achieve their
                professional and personal goals, making learning an engaging, transformative experience.</p>

            <p class="career_adaptability__text paragraph">Throughout my tenure at prestigious language institutions
                like Berlitz and Wall Street English, I've had the privilege of designing and delivering engaging
                lessons for both adults and children. This unique experience not only honed my pedagogical skills but
                also enriched my soft skills portfolio, including effective communication, empathy, active listening,
                and adaptability. These skills have proven invaluable, especially in collaborative environments such as
                Scrum teams, where understanding team dynamics and fostering a supportive atmosphere are crucial for
                success. My journey through the realms of language teaching has equipped me with a versatile skill set,

            <p class="card2__text paragraph">In my evolution from an English teacher to a dedicated language

                it career advancement, academic success, or personal enrichment—has been pivotal. Through tailored
                coaching, I've helped them set clear objectives, understand their learning journey, and manage deadlines
                effectively, mirroring the agile methodology used in Scrum teams. This process not only heightened their
                language proficiency but also instilled essential life skills such as strategic planning, effective
                communication, and adaptability. By aligning educational pursuits with personal ambitions, we've turned
                language learning into a path towards achieving broader life goals.</p>
